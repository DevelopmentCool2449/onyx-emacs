OnyX *Emacs* is a configuration focused on creating and managing *Org-mode* and *Markdown*
based notes *for Android*, with an *intuitive* an easy UI.

*⚠️ NOTE: This configuration is intended for Emacs Android Port and may not work correctly on other OS.*

* Requirements
+ Android 2.2 or 15.0 version.
+ Android Emacs Port (latest release).
+ =Symbols Nerd Font= and =RobotoMono Nerd Font=.
+ ~git~ /(optional)/

* Installation
** Installing Emacs
The most recommended way to install Emacs is [[https://f-droid.org/en/package/org.gnu.emacs][from F-Droid]], download the build that
is *compatible with your architecture* /(usually those with the "recommended" label)/.

If you have problems installing packages, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Android-Software.html][it may be necessary to install
additional applications such as Termux]], you can find specific builds to allow
the use of Termux applications on [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/][Android ports for GNU Emacs Files sourceforge]]
and install both Emacs and Termux .apk packages.

** Installing OnyX
Download this repository, inside OnyX folder create a directory called =fonts= and
install the fonts you prefer to use in Emacs (Onyx uses =Symbols Nerd Font= and
=RobotoMono Nerd Font= fonts, make sure they are downloaded in fonts folder, you
can download them [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads][here]]).

And move Onyx Directory to the path you prefer on Android (usually,
it's recommended somewhere in =/storage/emulated/0/=).

Once downloaded, launch Emacs, go to *Edit > Execute Command* and type ~eshell~

within eshell prompt run this command to make a symbolic link from Onyx path
to ~/.emacs.d directory:

#+begin_src shell
ln -s /storage/emulated/0/<path-to-onyx> ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Then close emacs and reopen it, and OnyX will take care of making a symbolic link
from the fonts folder to ~/fonts.

* User configurations
OnyX tries to be as simple as possible regarding configurations, inside the OnyX
directory you can find a file =user-configurations.el= that is intended to save
personal configurations and packages, you can also customize all the internal
files of OnyX.

*Feel Free to do so!*
